### OLS model explanation
Based on the results you provided, we can interpret the multiple linear regression model as follows:

Model Summary: The model has the form pm2_5 ~ 1 + o3 + no2 + so2 + co + temp + pressure + humidity + wind_speed + clouds. This means that the PM2.5 concentration is modeled as a linear combination of the other variables with corresponding coefficients.
R-squared and Adjusted R-squared: The R-squared value is 0.9338, which means that approximately 93.38% of the variation in PM2.5 concentration can be explained by the model. The adjusted R-squared value is 0.9321, which is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It's very close to R-squared, indicating that the predictors contribute significantly to explaining the variation in PM2.5.
Model Coefficients: The coefficients represent the relationship between each predictor and the response variable, PM2.5. For example, the coefficient of co is 0.11636, which means that for each unit increase in CO, the PM2.5 concentration is expected to increase by 0.11636 units, holding all other variables constant.
P-values for each predictor: P-values help us determine the significance of each predictor in the model. Typically, a p-value threshold of 0.05 is used to determine if a predictor is statistically significant. Here's a summary of the predictors' significance:
o3 (Ozone): p-value = 0.28588, not significant
no2 (Nitrogen Dioxide): p-value = 0.19046, not significant
so2 (Sulfur Dioxide): p-value = 0.03704, significant
co (Carbon Monoxide): p-value = 1.337e-91, highly significant
temp (Temperature): p-value = 1.0339e-27, highly significant
pressure (Pressure): p-value = 2.1333e-05, highly significant
humidity (Humidity): p-value = 3.1661e-05, highly significant
wind_speed (Wind Speed): p-value = 0.05030, marginally significant
clouds (Clouds): p-value = 0.01389, significant
Interpretation: Based on the model, the most significant predictors of PM2.5 concentration are CO, temperature, pressure, and humidity. SO2, wind speed, and clouds also show some significance, while O3 and NO2 are not significant predictors of PM2.5 in this dataset.



### Stepwise 


Stepwise regression is a method used in statistics and machine learning to select the most relevant predictor variables for a model from a larger set of potential predictors. The goal is to create a model that effectively predicts an outcome (response) variable while using a smaller number of predictor variables.

The method works by iteratively adding and removing predictor variables to the model based on their contribution to the model's overall predictive power. In simple terms, stepwise regression follows these steps:

Start with an initial model (which may include no predictors or a specified set of predictors).
Add the predictor variable that most improves the model's predictive power (usually measured by a statistic like R-squared or an information criterion like AIC or BIC). If no predictors significantly improve the model, stop the process.
Check if any predictor variable in the current model can be removed without significantly reducing the model's predictive power. If so, remove that predictor variable.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more predictors can be added or removed, resulting in the final model.
The resulting model, which includes the selected predictor variables, is expected to provide the best balance between simplicity and predictive accuracy. In simpler terms, stepwise regression helps to find a model that uses fewer predictor variables while still effectively predicting the outcome.




### LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a statistical method used to find the best predictors (variables) for a given target variable. It helps you build a model that can make accurate predictions using a subset of the available predictors while avoiding overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns the noise in the training data, which can hurt its performance on unseen data.
% 
% In simple terms, LASSO regression works as follows:
% 
% Start with a dataset containing multiple predictors (input variables) and a target variable (output).
% Instead of using all predictors, LASSO tries to find the most important ones that contribute to predicting the target variable.
% It does this by adding a penalty to the model based on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (weights) of the predictors. This penalty encourages the model to use fewer predictors by shrinking the coefficients of less important predictors towards zero.
% The penalty is controlled by a parameter called lambda. A higher value of lambda results in more shrinkage, potentially excluding more predictors, while a smaller value allows more predictors to be included in the model.
% To find the best value of lambda, you can use cross-validation. This process involves dividing the dataset into several subsets and training the model on each subset while evaluating its performance on the remaining data. By comparing the model's performance across different values of lambda, you can find the optimal value that strikes a balance between simplicity and predictive accuracy.
% In summary, LASSO regression helps you build a more interpretable and generalizable model by selecting a subset of important predictors and avoiding overfitting.
Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step and explain the purpose of each section:

Import necessary libraries:
matlab
Copy code
import('matlab.io.*');
This line imports the MATLAB I/O library, which provides functions to read and write data from various file formats, including CSV files.

Load the data from the CSV file:
matlab
Copy code
filename = 'Warsaw_data.csv';
dataTable = readtable(filename);
These lines define the filename of the CSV file and read the data into a table called dataTable.

Preprocess the data (optional):
matlab
Copy code
dataTable.date = []; % Remove the date column
dataTable.pm10 = []; % Remove the pm10 column
These lines remove the 'date' and 'pm10' columns from the dataset, as they are not needed for this analysis.

Split the data into training and testing sets:
matlab
Copy code
splitRatio = 0.7; % 70% for training, 30% for testing
splitIndex = floor(height(dataTable) * splitRatio);
trainData = dataTable(1:splitIndex, :);
testData = dataTable(splitIndex + 1:end, :);
These lines split the data into training and testing sets. The splitRatio is set to 0.7, meaning 70% of the data is used for training and 30% for testing. The splitIndex calculates the index at which to split the dataset. The trainData and testData variables store the respective training and testing data.

Extract predictors and response:
matlab
Copy code
predictors = trainData{:, 2:end}; % All columns except pm2_5
response = trainData.pm2_5;
These lines extract the predictor variables (all columns except 'pm2_5') and the response variable ('pm2_5') from the training data.

Perform LASSO regression with cross-validation:
matlab
Copy code
[B, FitInfo] = lasso(predictors, response, 'CV', 10); % 10-fold cross-validation
This line performs LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation. The lasso function returns the coefficients (B) and the fit information (FitInfo) for different values of lambda. The cross-validation helps to choose the best lambda value.

Analyze the results:
matlab
Copy code
lassoPlot(B, FitInfo, 'PlotType', 'Lambda', 'XScale', 'log');
This line creates a plot of the LASSO coefficients for different values of lambda. It helps to visualize how the coefficients change with different levels of regularization.

Find the optimal lambda and the corresponding coefficients:
matlab
Copy code
optimalLambdaIndex = FitInfo.Index1SE; % One standard error rule
optimalB = B(:, optimalLambdaIndex);
selectedPredictors = find(optimalB ~= 0); % Indices of the selected predictors
These lines find the optimal value of lambda using the "One Standard Error" rule, which is stored in FitInfo.Index1SE. The corresponding coefficients (optimalB) are then extracted. The selectedPredictors variable contains the indices of the predictors with non-zero coefficients.

Display the selected predictors:
matlab
Copy code
disp('Selected predictors:');
disp(trainData.Properties.VariableNames(1, selectedPredictors + 1));
These lines display the names of the selected predictors in the console.

The purpose of this code is to perform LASSO regression with cross-validation to select the most important predictors for the 'pm2_5' target variable.
